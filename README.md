# P4wnP1-A.L.O.A. Payloads

The scripts (for Windows and OSX), HIDScripts (for Windows) and RAW HID Attacks Scripts have been tested and verified. They've been adapted to integrate and work with my customized P4wnP1 Image. You'll find this repository pre-included in the root directory of the image. To ensure you have the latest version, execute a 'git pull' command once in a while.

If you plan to use this repository with a different image, be prepared to make the necessary adjustments to the scripts for compatibility.
